# TourMega

Three different files for the following three tasks

1. Fill in key words
2. Generate similar questions
3. Map user question to similar question in dataset

These are very initial versions of what I would do for these problems, but I wanted to get this in and show you my code!  The final results will be better for 3. if the full system was implemented where entities were already filled, but I wanted to show each of the three systems in isolation on the original data.
